Features of java:
1.Simple->java is a very simple language,we can learn and write the java programms easily,to write any 
programm we need to follow some syntax,if we know c and c++ syntax then we can write and understand the
java programm easily.
2.Object oriented->in c and c++ no need of using any class or object 
but java is completely object oriented,here in java we cannont write any programm without 
class and object,so it gives best maintainance whenever we develop a webapplication.
3.Portable->java is portable y bcz see whatever the programm we write is ntg but it is a source code to 
convert it as bytecode we need compiler so compiler converts source code to byte code so that byte
code can be taken in someother operating system and it can be executed.for example,,we can take that bytecode 
in pendrive and can execute in other operating system....
4.Platform indipendent->the main feature of java is platform independent,,why bcz java can be written 
in any platform it can be executed in other platform for example if we write java pgm in windows then
we can execute it in linux.
5.Secure->java is secured language,here y we are telling java as secure means whatever the members are in
can be made private so that it will not allow to other device or progammer to use the same programm,,
one more thing is java is made viruss free so if any athantication are thr means it will detect thr 
only.
6.Architectural neutral->
7.Robust->java is robust means it is a strong language y bcz thr are 2 reasons *it is having jvm which 
can handle error acceptions not only acceptions it will show what is a error and y that error took place
one more reason is*it has automatic garbage collection what it will do is if in programm is thr any
methods which we are not using then those will be automatically removed by java
8.Interpreted->see here in java it will have its sourcecode as .java and this can be converted to .class
by using compiler,,here interprted will have jvm that is java runtime error what this will do is
it will convert this .class file to output,,so bcz of this reason java is interpreted.
9.High perforance->we say that performance of java is high bcz in java compiler proviodes  bytecodes which can
be  executed very easily using java run time error(jvm)so bcz of this performance of java is high.
easily and 
10.Multitreaded->here in java for single thread different different memory will not be given only one 
memory will be given to single thread
11.Ddynamic->why we call java is dynamic means....in java during run time we can make any changes if we want
it may be method or  class whatever it may be we can change it if we want during run time.
12.Distributed->java can be distributed see java pgms are made to run on internet so means we can
use java pgms on different different networks means it can distirbuted in different different networks
and we can use protocalls in java like stpp and all just to access pgm or data in internet.

*Syntax of java:->
class Main{
public static void main(String args[]){
System.out.println();
}
}
every line of java code in program which runs must be written inside the class...in above syntax or example we can see that i had written as class Main 
here 'Main' is nothing but a class name and the code whatever we want to run must be in side this class only.and while saving the java code we must save 
with class name.java..and in above example we can see that after the class thr is a method which we call it as main method so whataver the code may be it 
will get executed....and in side the main method we can make use the print (System.out.println)method to print or screen the text whichever we want...and curly
braces should mandantory to use at begging and at the end of the program bcz bit means that '{'starting of the program '}'end of the program.
